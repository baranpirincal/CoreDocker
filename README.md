Sample project using .net core and docker file.

 * Integrate with travis and testing
 * Build and deploy docker file.
 * Better API with integrated website.
 * Add nbuilder back into the mix
 * decide what to do about logging, still not sold on the injection method
 * Signal-r replacement.
 * Authentication - github or google would be awesome.
